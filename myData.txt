Software engineering is an engineering disipline concerning 
all aspects of software production, including software analysis, 
design, development, testing, and depoyment. SE requires 
profound abstract and logical thinking and the application of 
mathematics, logic, and computer science in order to produce 
efficient and reliable software with the available resources.

It is hard to overstate the ubiquity of software nowdays. 
Every computer system is govened by software. Almost every human 
activity involves software in some form. Undoubtedly software 
industry is one of the largest and fastest growing industries in 
the world. Consequently, skilled software engineers are in high 
demand worldwide. As software becomes more and more complex, the 
programmming skills and the rudimentary knowledge of software 
engineering that students obtained from traditional computer 
science and computer engineering curriculums are insufficient. 
The development of real world software applications requires the 
skills in analysing the problem domain and the requirement and the 
skills in designing the software from the topmost level down to 
the implementation level. Moreover, a software engineer must be 
able to use proper tools, techniques, and methudologies in order 
to produce the software in an efficient maner.
